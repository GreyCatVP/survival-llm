"""Check whether models cite sources they never read, and whether they say so when answering from memory.

Usage: .venv/bin/python evals/citation_check.py MODEL [MODEL ...]
Asks each model the questions below with the library, the way the app does, and reports every source a model
named in its "Sources:" line that it neither opened nor saw in its search results (core.py replaces such a line
with what the model actually read, so the person never sees it), plus answers that used no library article
without saying so. --recheck re-scores saved answers with the current check, without asking the models again.
Writes evals/results/citations-<model>.json and prints a summary.
